## Arrays Indexing

Array elements can be fetched by their index number (starts from 0).

```
myArr = ['Hello', , 54.3, true];

console.log( myArr[0] );   // prints Hello
console.log( myArr[1] );   // prints undefined
console.log( myArr[2] );   // prints 54.3
console.log( myArr[3] );   // prints true
```
